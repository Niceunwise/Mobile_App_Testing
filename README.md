# Mobile App Testing
In this repository I've put the testing artifacts made during the mobile testing module.

I've executed Android mobile app testing using real device and Android studio emulator ([apk](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IkqWnm6z293ETG0MdveKTjrsrWd7WQHz/view)) and made the following testing documentation:

1. [Check-list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12SotyRIq8lH5j7JCjq4t_DIyieck5_bH/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=112360410079709621314&rtpof=true&sd=true) for functional testing.

2. Test cases for task adding module were made via Qase (attached).

3. Bug reports were made via Youtrack (also attached).

4. [Testing report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YPUZG-IigQdxslUF3Tn3T3b6X-AYBNpM/view?usp=sharing).
